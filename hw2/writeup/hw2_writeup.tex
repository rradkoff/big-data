\section{Data Visualization}

We identified three sets of covariates that affect housing prices:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Income/education level: home price tends to rise with income (and with education, which correlates highly with income);
\item Home/neighborhood quality: nice homes and nice neighborhoods demand a price premium; and
\item First-time status: first-time home buyers tend to purchase less expensive homes.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Income \& Education}

Unsurprisingly, buyers with higher income and more education are able to afford more expensive homes. We see in Figure~\vref{fig:hhgrad} that the purchase price of a home increases with each additional level of educaiton achieved. In Figure~\vref{fig:income}, we see that home value rises with income, but much of the variation in income is explained by having a college degree. Red dots, signifying purchasers with a college or graduate degree, are concentrated in the northeast corner, signifying high incomes and expensive homes. Blue dots, signifying purchasers without a college degree, have lower incomes and (expectedly) less expensive homes.

\end{figure}

In addition to more expensive homes, more education correlates with neighborhood quality. Figure~\vref{fig:education_qual} shows the share of households by terminal degree level in good and bad neighborhoods. More educated buyers are more likely to have homes in good neighborhoods; we expect that this is really an income story, as education increases income which affords higher neighborhood quality.

  \label{fig:education_qual}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Neighborhood \& Home}

The value of a home is also driven by the quality of the home and the surrounding neighborhood. We expect that nicer homes in nicer neighborhoods will cost more. We see in Figure~\vref{fig:ejunk} and Figure~\vref{fig:eaban} that two proxies for neighborhood quality\textemdash the presence of junk in the street and proximity to abandoned buldings\textemdash both lower home value.

\begin{figure}[!htb]

  \label{fig:eaban}
\end{figure}

As we would expect, homes that are identified as ``good'' quality cost more than those that are not, and good neighborhoods carry a premium over bad neighborhoods (Figure~\ref{fig:howh} and Figure~\ref{fig:hown}, respectively).

\end{figure}

\subsection{First-time Buyers \& Financing Source}

Finally, we examine the difference paid for first-time home buyers versus repeat home buyers. We have two different data sources that tell a similar story. First, buyers who are purchasing their first home tend to pay less than those who are buying a second (or third) home (see Figure~\vref{fig:frstho}). We expect that this is due to age and income differences; first-time home buyers will tend to be younger and have less accumulated wealth than repeat buyers. 

We see that the source of financing for a down payment tells a very similar story. Buyers that use a previous home to pay down their purchase buy more expensive homes (see Figure~\vref{fig:dwnpay}). We expect that this is capturing the same effect as described above: namely, that if a previous home is used as a source of financing, that signals an older buyer with higher income and greater wealth.

\section{Linear Model}

We begin by regressing the log of home value onto all possible co-variates (excluding mortgage amount and purchase price, which are known functions of home value). If we apply a false discover rate of 10 percent, we find that there are 34 true discoveries. We regress log of home value on these 34 covariates; the results are displayed in Table~\vref{tab:reg1_fdr}.

The model fit does not change meaningfully between estimates; the R-squared of the first model is 0.3053 and the R-squared of the second model is 0.3050. Removing the extraneous covariates should give us more accurate estimates for the effects of each covariate on home value.

Some notes on the linear regression model:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Every state included in the model (there were 13) is a significant covariate. California is the most expensive state; Texas is the cheapest.
  \item More education increases the value of home purchased, but income seems to have very little effect (that is not already included in educaiton).
  \item Number of bedrooms and bathrooms both increase home value, but the relationship is stronger for number of bathrooms (i.e. it is the best proxy of home size).
  \item The neighborhood and home quality measures that we saw in the first section appear in our regression results. Junk in the street lowers home value, as do nearby abandoned buildings. Good homes and neighborhoods cost more than bad ones.
\end{itemize}
