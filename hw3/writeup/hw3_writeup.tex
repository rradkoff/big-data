\section{Player Contribution Regression}

The model for player contribution is:
\[ \log\left[\frac{Pr(y=1)}{1-Pr(y=1)}\right] = \beta_0 + \alpha_{\texttt{team,season}} + \alpha_{\texttt{config}} + \sum_{\texttt{homeplyr}} \beta_j + \sum_{\texttt{awayplyr}} \beta_j \]
For a given player \textit{j}, the model estimates the odds multiplier that a goal scored while player \textit{j} is on the ice was scored by the his team. It includes the following two control factors:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \texttt{team,season}: This should control for high- or low-offense years, certain arenas that provide a special home-ice advantage, or coaches that are better/worse than average; and
  \item \texttt{config}: This should control for disproportionate playing time in power plays or end-of-game situations where the goalie has been pulled.
\end{itemize}
To use one example, the coefficient on Alex Ovechkin is 0.30. This means that a goal scored while Ovechkin is on the ice is $\exp(0.30)=1.35$ times as likely to be scored by his team, the Washington Capitals, than by their opponents. Put differently, if a goal is scored while Ovi is on the ice, it is 35 percent more likely that it is scored by the Caps than by their opponents.

We can sort the array of player coefficients to determine the 10 most and least valuable players in the data set. We show the results in Table~\ref{tab:best10} and Table~\ref{tab:worst10}. This evaluation metric accords with our intution about hockey. The list of 10 best players includes some of the conventionally-regarded best players of the last decade, which tells us the model is doing a reasonably good job of quantifying performance. It also includes one player (Tyler Toffoli) who has only played since 2013, although his brief career has been successful to date. Table~\ref{tab:best10} and Table~\ref{tab:worst10} have a column labeled \textbf{G}, displaying the number of goals a player was on the ice for. We can see that Toffoli is indeed an inexperienced player compared to veterans like Joe Thornton and Pavel Datsyuk

By this performance metric, the best and worst players are both outliers and most players have a 0 rating. The sample includes 2439 players and only 646 have non-zero ratings (390 have net positive and 256 have net negative ratings). We can see in Figure~\ref{fig:play_rtg} that only a small handful of players are significantly better or significanlty worse than average.

\section{Gamma-Lasso Regression Standardization}

The Gamma-Lasso regression estimates the coefficients $\beta_j$ by minimizing an objective function similar to:
\[ \min_{\lambda} \left( -\frac{2}{n}\log \text{LHD}(\beta) + \lambda \sum_{j} c(\beta_j) \right) \]
For this discussion, we will assume that the cost function is a simple lasso of the form $c(\beta_j) = \lvert \beta_j \rvert$. In most cases we would scale this penalty function by the standard deviation of $x_j$, but doing so in this example would penalize players who have been on the ice for a large number of goals.

We ran the Gamma-Lasso regression setting \texttt{standardize=TRUE} and the resulting list of the 10 best players had been on the ice for a combined 31 goals between them. We can look more closely at two example players, Pavel Datsyuk and Jeff Toms, to see how the standardized penalty functions led to this outcome.

Datsyuk is a long-tenured player who has been on the ice for 1725 goals; he is ranked 7th by our logit regression model. Toms had a long career in the NHL and minor leagues but played his last NHL game in 2002, seeing action in only eight games and being on the ice for only four goals (which are the only four included in our data set). For Datsyuk, $\mathrm{var}(x_j)=0.0248$ while for Toms, $\mathrm{var}(x_j)=\num{5.7597e-5}$.

Figure~\ref{fig:cost_fcn} shows what the lasso penatly functions look like for each player \textit{after} they have been scaled by the standard deviation of $x_j$. We can see that there is a very high cost for the coefficient on Pavel Datsyuk and almost no cost on the coefficeint for Jeff Toms. What this means for the estimation is that the coefficient on Datsyuk is very likely to be small, and the coefficeint on Toms is very likely to be larger. This is in fact what we see from running the Gamma-Lasso regression setting \texttt{standardize=TRUE}; the coefficnet on Datsyuk is 0.2908 while the coefficent on Toms is 1.7381.
