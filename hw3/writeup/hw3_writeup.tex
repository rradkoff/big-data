\section{Player Contribution Regression}

The model for player contribution is:
\[ \log\left[\frac{Pr(y=1)}{1-Pr(y=1)}\right] = \beta_0 + \alpha_{\texttt{team,season}} + \alpha_{\texttt{config}} + \sum_{\texttt{homeplyr}} \beta_j + \sum_{\texttt{awayplyr}} \beta_j \]
For a given player \textit{j}, the model estimates the odds multiplier that a goal scored while player \textit{j} is on the ice was scored by the his team. It includes the following two control factors:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \texttt{team,season}: This should control for high- or low-offense years, certain arenas that provide a special home-ice advantage, or coaches that are better/worse than average; and
  \item \texttt{config}: This should control for disproportionate playing time in power plays or end-of-game situations where the goalie has been pulled.
\end{itemize}
To use one example, the coefficient on Alex Ovechkin is 0.30. This means that a goal scored while Ovechkin is on the ice is $\exp(0.30)=1.35$ times as likely to be scored by his team, the Washington Capitols, than by their opponents. Put differently, if a goal is scored while Ovi is on the ice, it is 35 percent more likely that it is scored by the Caps than by their opponents.

We can sort the array of player coefficients to determine the 10 most and least valuable players in the data set. We show the results in Table~\ref{tab:best10} and Table~\ref{tab:worst10}. This evaluation metric accords with our intution about hockey. The list of 10 best players includes some of the conventionally-regarded best players of the last decade, which tells us the model is doing a reasonably good job of quantifying performance. It also includes one player (Tyler Toffoli) who has only played since 2013, although his brief career has been successful to date. Table~\ref{tab:best10} and Table~\ref{tab:worst10} have a column labeled \textbf{G}, displaying the number of goals a player was on the ice for. We can see that Toffoli is indeed an inexperienced player compared to veterans like Joe Thornton and Pavel Datsyuk

By this performance metric, the best and worst players are both outliers and most players have a 0 rating. The sample includes 2439 players and only 646 have non-zero ratings (390 have net positive and 256 have net negative ratings). We can see in Figure~\ref{fig:play_rtg} that only a small handful of players are significantly better or significanlty worse than average.
