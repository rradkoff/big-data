\section{Node Connectivity Transformation}

Node connectivity (which we are calling \texttt{degree}) is measured by the number of edges for each node in a network. In this context, \texttt{degree} tells us the number of relationships that a household in our population has. We observe in Figure~\ref{fig:degrees} that \texttt{degree} is distributed logarithmically.

\section{Predicting Node Connectivity from Controls}
\label{sec:predict}

In this section, we build a model to predict a node's degree by using only our control variables. Our model is: 

\[ d = \beta_0 + \bm{X} \bm{\beta} + \varepsilon \]

where $d$ is a node's number of degrees, $\bm{X}$ is a vector of control variables including village, religion, type of roof on home, rooms and beds in home, a dummy variable for having electricity in home, whether a home is owned, and whether the person is a ``leader'' in the village. 

We estimate this model using a Gamma-Lasso regression. In Figure~\ref{fig:treat_aic} in the Appendix, we show the Gamma-Lasso path plots with five decision criteria marked: AIC, AICc, BIC, CV.Min, and CV.1se. The $\log(\lambda)$ selected by AICc and by CV.Min are reasonably close to each other (-4.60 and -4.46, respectively, shown in Table~\ref{tab:treat_ic} in the Appendix), which provides us with a confirmation that our model is estimated reasonably well.

We then use the model selected by AICc to predict degree (which we will call $\hat{d}$). We plot $d$ against $\hat{d}$ in Figure~\ref{fig:d_vs_dhat} and see that there is only a very rough correlation between the two ($\sigma_{d,\hat{d}}=0.34$)

\begin{figure}[!htb]

  \includegraphics[scale=.5]{d_vs_dhat.eps}
  \caption{Degree and Predicted Degree}
  \label{fig:d_vs_dhat}
\end{figure}

This is a positive result. It tells us that most of the variation in degree, which will be our treatment variable in Section~\ref{sec:model}, is exogenous and cannot be explained by the control variables that we observe. We can therefore measure the effect of degree as a treatment on the propensity to take out a loan and be reasonably sure that we are not simply measuring variation in other observed control variables.
