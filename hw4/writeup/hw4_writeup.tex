\section{Network Connectivity Transformation}

Network connectivity (which we are calling \texttt{degree}) is measured by the number of edges for each node in a network. In this context, \texttt{degree} measures the number of relationships that a household in our population has. We observe in Figure~\ref{fig:degrees} that \texttt{degree} is distributed logarithmically.
