In this section we plot the actors' network as a whole (see \Vref{fig:all_actors}).  For this plot, the node-size remained constant with the vertex color varying based on an actor's degree of connectedness (more blue for less connected and more red for well connected).  The data-set has \Sexpr{all_actors} actors in it.  The degree of connectedness in the set of actors is shown in \Vref{fig:actor_hist}.  This histogram shows that most actors have worked with between 40 and 60 other actors, although the heavy tail in this distribution indicates that many have worked with far more.  For instance ``\Sexpr{mostConnectedActor}'' has worked with \Sexpr{mostConnectedDegree} others.

Kevin Bacon's network can be visualized in \Vref{fig:bacon}.  In each of these plots, the node-size of each actor is sized according to their degree within the overall actors' network.  That is, larger degree actors have bigger nodes.  The coloring scheme used was to label 3rd-degree connections blue, 2nd-degree green, 1st-degree red, with Kevin Bacon's node colored black (see \Vref{r:bacon} for code used to generate these plots).

<<bacon_calc>>=
act1stBigger <- sum(degree(actnet)[V(actor1st)] > degree(actnet)[actor])/length(V(actor1st))*100
act1stConns <- length(V(actor1st))-1
act2ndBigger <- sum(degree(actnet)[V(actor2nd)] > degree(actnet)[actor])/length(V(actor2nd))*100
act2ndConns <- length(V(actor2nd))-1
act3rdBigger <- sum(degree(actnet)[V(actor3rd)] > degree(actnet)[actor])/length(V(actor3rd))*100
act3rdConns <- length(V(actor3rd))-1
@

In \Cref{fig:bacon1} we see his 1st-degree connections and note that while Kevin Bacon is relatively well connected with \Sexpr{act1stConns} connections, \Sexpr{act1stBigger}\% of his connections have a higher degree than he does. In \Cref{fig:bacon2} we visualize 2nd-degree connections and note that of the \Sexpr{act2ndConns} connections, \Sexpr{act2ndBigger}\% have a higher degree.  Also because of the way R rendered the visualization, we cannot really see any 1st degree conenctions.  In \Cref{fig:bacon3} we visualize 3rd-degree connections and see a much better visual dispersion of the three types of connections.  Of the \Sexpr{act3rdConns} connections, \Sexpr{act3rdBigger}\% have more connections than Kevin Bacon.

We can determine the most common actors by summing up the columns of the actors' matrix and sorting the result. The actor appearing in the most films is \textbf{\Sexpr{cleanActNames[most_common]}}, who appeared in \Sexpr{nroles[most_common]} films has appeared with \Sexpr{actDegree[most_common]} other actors. The most connected actor is \textbf{\Sexpr{cleanActNames[most_connected]}} has been in \Sexpr{nroles[most_connected]} films and has worked with a total of \Sexpr{actDegree[most_connected]} actors.

2 x-tables <- 1 with 5 most common actors (# of connections), 1 with 5 most connected (# of conn)

Here, we randomly select two actors \textbf{\Sexpr{cleanActNames[actSample[1]]}} and \textbf{\Sexpr{cleanActNames[actSample[2]]}}. The shortest path between them contains \Sexpr{length(spath)-1} vertices: \Sexpr{common_movies}.

@
We first looked for association rules with at least 0.01 percent support and 10 percent confidence, but it turns out that there are none. If we think about support as the unconditional probability of an actor being in a movie, then the maximum support of any actor in the network is for \textbf{\Sexpr{cleanActNames[most_common]}}: she appeared in \Sexpr{nroles[most_common]} out of a possible \Sexpr{nfilms} films, so her support would be \Sexpr{min_support}. Of course there would be no association rules with support of at least 0.01 if the maximum support of the network is less than this threshold.
